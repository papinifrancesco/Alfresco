In all-in-one installation we have both of the webapps, /alfresco and /share, on the same machine but what if the customer wants a dedicated /share one?

While we can set up another tomcat on the same machine, to keep things simple and to adhere to the scenario I strongly recommend to create another VM: clone the one you have already and allocate no more than 2GB of RAM.

On the second VM remember to leave only the /share webapp and nothing else: it is a sort of front end after all.

So, remove /alfresco
rm -rf /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/alfresco

Stop (and remove) the: DB , transformation services, solr, activemq, the unneeded systemd files.

Do I need the "contentstore" and "contentstore.deleted"?
  
No, because only the /alfresco webapp use them and /share talks only with /alfresco .


Then modify:
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/web-extension/share-config-custom.xml

basically replace "localhost" with the IP of your first VM, the one with the /alfresco webapp .


Restart tomcat and try to connect with you browser to:

http://VM2IP:8080/share

you should be able to access.
