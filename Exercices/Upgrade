Sooner or later it'll have to done: the ACS upgrade.

Upgrading means:
1) making sure we have a backup of contentstore, keystore and DB
2) upgrading ACS


Now, the situation is: pretend we inherit an installation of which we know nothing, before anything else let's dump all of the applied ACS setting with a JMX dump.

A) use the webGUI at /alfresco/s/enterprise/admin/admin-jmx-settings
OR
B) curl -o jmxdump.zip -u {admin_user}:{admin_password} http://{host}:{port}/alfresco/s/api/admin/jmxdump

the webGUI is more handy in this case because we can easily see if something has been configured using the GUI or not: it would be better to "revert" the GUI settings
and have them configured in the files on the filesystem (alfresco-global.properties but not only).

Remember to ALWAYS keep the old folder:
/opt/alfresco/alf_data/keystore/
unless you have reason to change its files and you are able to manipulate them
(I've manipulated the keystore files once to extract its raw key and re-insert it in a new, AES based, keystore file once)


That done, let have a look at which webapps we have:
ll /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/

and, inside these webapps, which AMPs are installed:
MMT list /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/alfresco
MMT list /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/share
we have to remember to install the new version of these AMPs

then, any modules loaded as .jar files?
ll /opt/alfresco/modules/platform/
ll /opt/alfresco/modules/share/
for the up to date version of these modules we should ask our DEVs to provide them


Now, the actual ACS installation should be compared with a same version, Vanilla one.
We can prepare a Vanilla one on our PC, make a .tgz of it and upload it to the actal ACS server , then we extract the archive and we make a comparison.

Go to the installation folder and make two symlinks (veeeeery handy):
cd /opt/
ll
[...]
alfresco-content-services-7.2.1-actual_installation
alfresco-content-services-7.2.1-my_Vanilla_installation

ln -fns alfresco-content-services-7.2.1-actual_installation O        # OLD
ln -fns alfresco-content-services-7.2.1-my_Vanilla_installation N    # NEW

at this point, inside your home folder, create the bin one:
cd
mkdir bin
cd bin

download "compareAlfrescos.sh" and make it executable:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/papinifrancesco/Alfresco/master/miscellaneous/compareAlfrescos.sh
chmod +x compareAlfrescos.sh

now go back to /opt and type:
compareAlfrescos.sh O N

copy the screen results to a notepad and then take a look of what's different (a lot of patience here):
what is not in the Vanilla installation is what we should remember to bring in the new, upgraded version
of ACS that we're preparing.

While this list is not exhaustive, it contains the most frequently modified files to check in a ACS installation:

/opt/alfresco/alf_data/keystore/*
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/conf/catalina.properties
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/conf/catalina.properties
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/conf/server.xml
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/alfresco.xml
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/share.xml
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco-global.properties

/opt/alfresco/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/custom-log4j.properties
OR
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/custom-log4j2.properties

/opt/alfresco/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/license/*
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/web-extension/share-config-custom.xml

/opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties
OR
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/log4j2.properties

/opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties
OR
/opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/classes/log4j2.properties



For ASS (Alfresco Search Services) the procedure is the same but we have no AMPs nor modules.

Usually these are the file to check:
/opt/solr/solr.in.sh
/opt/solr/solrhome/alfresco/conf/solrcore.properties
/opt/solr/solrhome/alfresco/conf/solrconfig.xml
/opt/solr/solrhome/archive/conf/solrcore.properties
/opt/solr/solrhome/archive/conf/solrconfig.xml
/opt/solr/solrhome/alfresco/conf/solrconfig.xml

but a "compareAlfrescos.sh" is always worth to be used.
