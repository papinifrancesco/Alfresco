Many times we will have to check if ACS is properly sending the emails or not so we have to know the troubleshooting sequence.

First of all: is true that ACS doesn't send emails or, maybe, ACS doesn't send emails in a very specific situation?

The customer will report his problem in his very own words but that doesn't mean it is as he says.

So, let's check a few things first.

Open alfresco-global.properties and check the values of mail.* fields.

Install swaks to send an email from the Alfresco machine.

dnf install -y swaks

swaks --from alfresco@domain.one --to myAccount@domain.two --server smtphost.domain.three --port 25

please be aware that maybe you will have to use TLS, have a look at the relevant options in advance

if the sending works then we know that the smtp server is ok and then the issue is really in Alfresco somewhere

to test it, access /share

create a test site if you don't have it already and then

go to "Document Library" and create a folder called "testEmail"

DO NOT enter testEmail and, instead, go to the right of the screen and click on "... More" and "Manage Rules"

"Create Rules" ,

Name: sendEmail
Perform Action: Send email
    Message...
        To: select your test user with the email defined or go back and create one
        Subject: smtp test from ACS - Customer X
        Message: just a test
    OK
