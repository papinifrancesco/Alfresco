# Alfresco uses ActiveMQ for versioning when we have more than 4 versions for a given node.
# I want to programmatically create a node and update it with at least 10 versions.
# A text file would do so:

# Create a file on your filesystem:
echo "V1.0" > AMQ_test.txt

# Create the node:
  curl -u "$USERNAME":"$PASSWORD" -X POST -F filedata=@AMQ_test.txt -F "relativePath=/Sites/Prova/documentLibrary/" http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/alfresco/versions/1/nodes/-root-/children
