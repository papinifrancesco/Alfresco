Probably our catalina.out will be full of /share cache related warnings.... too many really.

To fix it, download:

https://github.com/papinifrancesco/Alfresco/blob/master/opt/alfresco/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/share.xml

and diff it with:

/opt/alfresco/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/share.xml

After having understood what the difference is, copy the downloaded share.xml over the original one.

Restart Alfresco and check catalina.out
