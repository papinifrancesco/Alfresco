Typical scenarios:
  you need to extend ACS functionality with a Hyland official module say: Google Docs.
                                    OR
  your devs extend ACS functionality with an in-house developed module: Company-repo.amp and Company-share.amp

While there are many ways to achieve the same result, the one below has proven over time to be the best one.


First, you get the AMP (or the AMPs) from Hyland's site or from your devs: up to you to copy to your VM somewhere.

Assuming you have an AMP for the repository part /alfresco and one for the webGUI /share:

Rename the AMP file appending a date to it, for example:
mv TAI-repo.amp TAI-repo_2023-06-28.amp

Move it under
  /opt/alfresco/amps/        if it is for the repository
  /opt/alfresco/amps_share/  if it is for the webGUI

You're unsure where to move the AMPs?
  Ask your devs OR
  look at its name: "repo" int the amps/ and "share" into qmps_share/


ACS needs to be restarted to load the new functonalities provided by the installed AMPs,
that activity will probably take place outside the normal office hours but we can prepare
the webapps anytime.

Then make a backup copy of the actual webapps:
cp -ar /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps.YYYY-MM-DD

Then make a copy of the actual webapps where we'll install the new AMPs
cp -ar /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps.NEW

Have a look at which, if any, AMPs are already installed:
MMT list /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/alfresco
MMT list /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/share

Install the AMPS:
MMT install /opt/alfresco/amps/Company-repo.amp        /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps.NEW/alfresco -force -nobackup
MMT install /opt/alfresco/amps_share/Company-share.amp /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps.NEW/share    -force -nobackup

Check if the AMPs installation worked:
MMT list /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps.NEW/alfresco
MMT list /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps.NEW/share

and compare the textual output with the previous "MMT list" generated one


If needed (maybe not), use:
chown -R alfresco:alfresco /opt/alfresco/

Wait for the agreed installation time with the customer, say 19h
STOP ACS:
systemctl stop alfresco

Verify it is really stopped:
ps -efw | grep java

Sync webapps.NEW/ to webapps/
rsync --delete -a /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps.NEW/ /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/

Start ACS:
systemctl start alfresco


Have a look at catalina.out (you never know).


Something wrong? We can go back with:
systemctl stop alfresco
rsync --delete -a /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps.YYYY-MM-DD/ /opt/alfresco/tomcat/webapps/
