Typical scenarios:
  you need to extend ACS functionality with a Hyland official module say: Google Docs.
                                    OR
  your devs extend ACS functionality with an in-house developed module: TAI-repo.amp and TAI-share.amp

While there are many ways to achieve the same result, the one below has proven over time to be the best one.


First, you get the AMP (or the AMPs) from Hyland's site or from your devs: up to you to copy to your VM somewhere.

Assuming you have an AMP for the repository part /alfresco and one for the webGUI /share:

Rename the AMP file appending a date to it, for example:
mv TAI-repo.amp TAI-repo_2023-06-28.amp

Move it under
  /opt/alfresco/amps/        if it is for the repository
  /opt/alfresco/amps_share/  if it is for the webGUI

You're unsure where to move the AMPs?
  Ask your devs OR
  look at its name: "repo" int the amps/ and "share" into qmps_share/
