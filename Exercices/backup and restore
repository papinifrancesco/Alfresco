Before anything else, we should always have a backup copy of the DB.
Ideally we should have a copy of the DB and of the contentstore taken at the same time and with a stopped ACS but:
a) the contentstore might be difficult to backup (say it is 5TB)
b) we can't stop ACS

Note: in that case, we should make sure our customer has at least a snapshot of the contentstore.

For this exercise however, we'll be working with our test environment so nothing unmanageable.

Stop ACS
copy the alf_data folder somewhere


log in to the VM with Postgresql (probably the same VM of ACS)
sudo su - postgres
date; pg_dump alfresco > /var/lib/pgsql/15/backup/alfresco.sql ; date

Once done with the backup, check alfresco.sql to make sure it has the expected data and then:
psql
