                                PREFACE


The innate love of change in man is visible even in the kitchen. Not
so very long ago soup was an exception in English houses--almost a
luxury. A dish of vegetables--as a dish and not an adjunct to meat--was
a still greater rarity; and even now plain-boiled potatoes, peas,
cabbages, etc., are the rule. When we read of the dishes, fearfully and
wonderfully made, in the old Italian _novelle_, we wonder whence the
present Italians got their love of vegetables and maccaroni.

Sacchetti tells us that in the fourteenth century a baked goose,
stuffed with garlic and quinces, was considered an exquisite dish; and
when the gonfalonier of Florence gave a supper to a famous doctor, he
put before him the stomach of a calf, boiled partridges, and pickled
sardines. Gianfigliazzi’s cook sent up a roasted crane to his master
as a delicacy, says Boccaccio; and a dish of leeks cooked with spices
appears as a special dish in the rules of the chapter of San Lorenzo
when the canons messed together. Old Laschi, author of that delightful
book _L’Osservatore Fiorentino_, moralises on the ancient fashion of
cooking in his pleasant rather prosy way: ‘It would not seem that
the senses should be subjected to fashion; and yet such is the case.
The perfumes, once so pleasing, musk, amber, and benzoin, now excite
convulsions; sweet wines, such as Pisciancio, Verdea, Montalcino, and
others mentioned by Redi in his dithyrambic, are now despised; and
instead of the heavy dishes of olden times, light and elegant ones are
in vogue. Whoever characterised man as a laughing animal ought rather
to have called him a variable and inconstant one.’

The dinner which set all Siena laughing for days, given to a favourite
of Pius II. by a Sienese who substituted wild geese for peacocks, after
cutting off their beaks and feet, and coloured his jelly with poisonous
ingredients, forms the subject of one of Pulci’s tales:--

‘Meanwhile it was ordered that hands should be washed, and Messer Goro
was seated at the head of the table, and then other courtiers who had
accompanied him; and they ate many tarts of good almond paste as a
beginning. Then was brought to Messer Goro the dish on which were the
peacocks without beaks, and a fellow was told to carve them. He not
being used to such office gave himself vast trouble to pluck them,[1]
but did it with so little grace that he filled the room and all the
table with feathers, and the eyes, the mouth, the nose, and the ears
of Messer Goro, and of them all. They, perceiving that it was from
want of knowledge, held their peace, and took a mouthful here and
there of other dishes so as not to disturb the order of the feast. But
they were always swallowing dry feathers. Falcons and hawks would have
been convenient that evening. When this pest had been removed many
other roasts were brought, but all most highly seasoned with cumin.
Everything would however have been pardoned if at the last an error had
not been committed, which out of sheer folly nearly cost Messer Goro
and those with him their lives. Now you must know that the master of
the house and his councillors, in order to do honour to his guest, had
ordered a dish of jelly. They wanted, as is the fashion in Florence and
elsewhere, to have the arms of the Pope and of Messer Goro with many
ornaments on it; so they used orpiment, white and red lead, verdigris
and other horrors, and set this before Messer Goro as a choice and new
thing. And Messer Goro and his companions ate willingly of it to take
the bitter taste of the cumin and the other strange dishes out of their
mouths, thinking, as is the custom in every decent place, that they
were all coloured with saffron, milk of sweet almonds, the juices of
herbs, and such like. And in the night it was just touch and go that
some of them did not stretch out their legs. Messer Goro especially
suffered much anguish from both head and stomach....’[2]

[1] Peacocks were skinned, not plucked, before cooking, and the skin
with the feathers was put on to the roasted bird, and the tail opened
out before placing the dish on the table. The ‘fellow’ ought to have
cut the stitches and drawn off the skin, instead of plucking the
feathers.

A company of Lombard pastrycooks came to Tuscany in the sixteenth
century, and introduced fine pastry into Florence. We find the first
mention of it in Berni’s _Orlando Innamorato_, where it is mentioned
among the choice viands. Laschi says, ‘the epoch of Charles V. is
the greatest of modern times, for the culture of the spirit induced
the culture of the body.’ But he does not mention vegetables or herbs
at all. For them we must go back to the ancients. Bitterly did the
Israelites, when wandering in the desert, regret ‘the cucumbers and
the melons we did eat in Egypt’; though old Gerarde says, ‘they yield
to the body a cold and moist nourishment, and that very little, and
the same not good.’ Gerarde is however hard to please, for he says
of egg-plants, under the old English name of Raging or Mad Apples,
‘doubtless these apples have a mischievous qualitie, the use whereof is
utterly to be forsaken.’

Fennel, dedicated to St. John, was believed to make the lean fat and
to give the weak strength, while the root pounded with honey was
considered a remedy against the bites of mad dogs. If lettuce be eaten
after dinner it cures drunkenness; but Pope says:--

                    If your wish be rest,
  Lettuce and cowslip wine, _probatum est_.

Sorrel is under the influence of Venus, and Gerarde declares that also
‘the carrot serveth for love matters; and Orpheus, as Pliny writeth,
said that the use hereof winneth love.’ Flowers of rosemary, rue, sage,
marjoram, fennel, and quince preserve youth; worn over the heart they
give gaiety. Rosemary is an herb of the sun, while Venus first raised
sweet marjoram, therefore young married couples are crowned with it in
Greece. While

  ‘He that eats sage in May
  Shall live for aye.’[3]

Sweet basil is often worn by the Italian maidens in their bosoms, as it
is supposed to engender sympathy, and borage makes men merry and joyful.

For years English friends have begged recipes for cooking vegetables in
the Italian fashion, so I have written down many of the following from
the dictation of our good Giuseppe Volpi, whose portrait, by Mr. A. H.
Hallam Murray, adorns this little book, and who has been known to our
friends for over thirty years.

I must also acknowledge, with thanks, the courtesy of Sigri. Fratelli
Ingegnoli of Milan, who have permitted me to use and translate what I
needed from their excellent little book _Come si Cucinano i Legumi_.

                            ITALIAN RECIPES




                             INTRODUCTION

                  _About the cooking of Vegetables._


Vegetables should be well washed in cold water to remove insects and
dust; if not fresh gathered, leave them some time in cold water,
and remember that they take longer to cook than fresh ones. Green
vegetables must be put into salted water (one tablespoonful of salt to
every two quarts of water) and rapidly cooked over a brisk fire in an
open sauce-pan until they are tender. All green vegetables should be
removed from the water as soon as cooked, and be well drained before
adding the seasoning.


                            _About Sauces._

So much depends on sauces that only the best ingredients should be used
in making them. Rancid or impure oil or bad butter will ruin sauces
and salads. Both butter and oil should always be tasted before buying,
as good cookery is impossible unless they are perfectly fresh and good
in every way; butter must be added to sauces in small bits, or it will
form a greasy line. To skim sauces, take the sauce-pan off the fire
and put in a teaspoonful of cold water, which will make the grease
rise. Remember that wine increases the taste of salt, so when wine is
used in a sauce put in very little salt until after the wine has been
added.


                             _About Eggs._

Eggs must be _quite_ fresh, if they taste of straw the sauce will be
spoiled. They should therefore be broken one at a time into a saucer
and examined before using. A pinch of salt added to the whites of eggs
makes them whisk better, and none of the yolk must be allowed to get
mixed in.


                            _About Spices._

The following is a good recipe for the spices so necessary in cooking:
Half an ounce of cloves, two ounces of nutmeg, half an ounce of sweet
basil, half an ounce of white pepper, two ounces of cinnamon, one
quarter of an ounce of dried bay leaves, half an ounce of thyme. Pound
well together, then pass through a sieve, and put them into a bottle,
or box, hermetically closed to preserve the perfume.


                          _About a Bouquet._

Take one bay leaf, one sprig of thyme, two cloves, and one stalk of
well-washed celery, place round these six sprigs of parsley, fold and
tie them so that the cloves, etc., cannot fall out.


                         _About Onion Juice._

Onion juice is obtained by grating an onion on a coarse grater, after
peeling it. Press hard, and each stroke will give one drop of juice.


                _About Maccaroni and Spaghetti Paste._

For every quarter of a pound of flour use one egg and two
tablespoonfuls of warm salted water. Take as much flour as needful,
make a hole in the centre, and put in the water and the eggs. Beat them
up with a spoon, mixing the flour in gradually, then knead well. Roll
the paste into very thin sheets, and place them on a clean cloth to dry
for half an hour. This paste will not keep more than one, or one and a
half days, and must always be put into boiling water or broth to cook.
If soaked before cooking the flavour is spoiled.


              _About blanching Maccaroni and Spaghetti._

Put an earthenware pot, filled with water, on the fire, add two
tablespoonfuls of salt, and boil. Put in three-quarters of a pound of
fresh maccaroni, twisting it round carefully so as not to break it.
Boil for seventeen minutes, then remove from the fire; drain, and put
it in cold water; drain again, and it is ready for use. Spaghetti are
blanched the same way.


                           _About Croûtons._

To make croûtons, cut bread into whatever shape you want. Take off the
crust, dip the pieces into melted butter, and toast in the oven, turn
often in order to colour evenly, or fry them in boiling oil or fat.
They must be crisp and of a light brown colour.


                         _About a Bain-Marie._

A Bain-Marie is a large copper pan placed on the fire, and containing
boiling water in which are put smaller pans with anything to be kept
hot, or cooked without boiling. Milk is better cooked in Bain-Marie,
than in a sauce-pan on the fire.




                                RECIPES


_Artichokes ‘alla Barigoul.’_

Clean and cut straight the under leaves of three large French
artichokes, boil them sufficiently to be able to take out the chokes,
and put them in cold water for five minutes. Drain thoroughly, then
fill the hole left by the choke with forcemeat made of half an ounce
of minced salt pork, two shallots, six mushrooms minced, a teaspoonful
of chopped parsley, a little pepper, and grated nutmeg, mixed well
together. Tie up the artichokes with string, heat three tablespoonfuls
of good olive oil in a pan, and brown them well on both sides. Then
place your artichokes in a sauté-pan, and put a small slice of fresh
pork, or a bit of good butter, on the top of each; add a tumbler of
broth, bake for forty minutes in oven, then place on a hot dish, and
serve, pouring the sauce in the pan over them.


_Artichokes ‘alla Barigoul’ (maigre)._

Parboil three fine French artichokes for three minutes, drain, pare
the tips and the bottoms, and remove the chokes. Then place them in a
sauce-pan with a tablespoonful of fresh butter, a carrot and an onion
sliced up, and very little salt. Cook a shallot (minced up) with a
tablespoonful of butter for three minutes (being careful not to let
it brown), add ten minced mushrooms, a tablespoonful of chopped-up
parsley, a teaspoonful of chopped-up chervil, and a little salt and
pepper; cook for five minutes, stirring often. Stuff the artichokes
with this, and put a whole mushroom on the top of each artichoke. Bake
in a hot oven, adding a wine-glassful of white wine and a tumbler of
vegetable soup; close the pan and cook for forty minutes. Add a quarter
of a pint of sauce ‘Vellutata’ (see Sauces, p. 127) to the sauce of the
artichokes, heat, but do not boil; strain, and serve in a sauce-boat
separately.


_Artichokes ‘Farciti.’_

Boil and drain twelve young artichokes. Chop up four ounces of boiled
ham and one pound of chicken-meat fine, add two tablespoonfuls of
cream, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a little pepper and salt,
and some grated nutmeg. Fill each artichoke with this compound, put
into a well-buttered frying-pan, and bake for a quarter of an hour in a
hot oven. Serve hot with ‘Alla Panna’ sauce (see Sauces, p. 125).


_Artichokes ‘al Forno.’_

Boil eight or ten young artichokes, then dry them well. Put a small
piece of onion on the top of each artichoke, wrap each in a slice of
ham, and stand them upright in a sauce-pan. In another sauce-pan make
your stuffings: four ounces of fine white lard cut up small, a quart
of broth, six mushrooms and a little parsley chopped up fine. Boil,
and when cooked pour this compound into each artichoke, put them into
the oven (not too hot) for about three-quarters of an hour. Before
serving be careful to remove any ham that has remained attached to the
artichokes, and pour some sauce ‘Olandese’ (see Sauces, p. 124) over
them.


_Artichokes ‘alla Francese.’_

Cut your artichokes into four or eight pieces according to their size,
remove the stalks and the hard leaves, and boil. Then sprinkle them
with lemon, and, to prevent them from turning brown, put them into hot
water with a good deal of vinegar. Drain well before serving, and after
putting them on a dish, pour a sauce made of pepper, salt, fine olive
oil, and a little vinegar over them, and serve hot.


_Artichokes ‘Fritti.’ No. 1._

Wash your artichokes and cut them into slices. When drained put them
into an earthen pot with some salt, pepper, fine olive oil, and a few
drops of vinegar. Put two yolks of eggs, one whole egg, a little water,
and some fine olive oil, into a frying-pan, and mix well together.
Throw the slices of artichoke into the frying-pan, stirring them well.
When they have taken a good colour remove them from the fire, strain
them, put them on a napkin in a dish, garnish with fried parsley and
serve very hot.


_Artichokes ‘Fritti.’ No. 2._

Cut eight or ten young artichokes into slices lengthways, take out
the chokes and cut off the ends of the leaves, and throw them into
vinegar and water; drain and dip them in the following batter:--two
tablespoonfuls of flour, the yolk of one egg, one spoonful of good
olive oil, and two tablespoonfuls of milk. Stir well; add one
tablespoonful of brandy (or water), pepper and salt to taste, and let
it stand for some hours. Before using whisk two whites of egg to a
stiff froth and beat it in.


_Artichokes ‘alla Graticola.’_

Wash your artichokes well, remove the stalks, the hard leaves, and the
points of the leaves; cut them in halves, and cook them on a gridiron.
Then sprinkle them with salt, some fine olive oil, and a little
pepper, and squeeze a few drops of lemon juice over them just before
serving up hot.


_Artichokes ‘all’ Italiana.’_

Clean the artichokes and remove the hard outside leaves. Boil them
well and leave them to drain. Arrange them on a dish and pour a sauce
‘Tartara, No. 1’ (see Sauces, p. 126) over them. Serve up quickly.


_Artichokes ‘alla Lionese.’_

Remove the stalk and the hard leaves, cut your artichoke into pieces,
then wash and drain them. Butter the bottom of a sauce-pan well, put in
the pieces of artichoke, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, and cook
them with a slow fire above and below until they take a golden colour.
When quite cooked, arrange them on a dish, and pour some fried fresh
butter over them, into which a pinch of sugar and three tablespoonfuls
of sauce ‘Suprema’ (see Sauces, p. 125) has been put. Serve up very hot.


_Artichokes ‘alla Milanese.’_

Put your boiled artichokes into an earthenware pot after greasing it
well with fresh butter, then place a bit of butter in the centre of
each artichoke and sprinkle them with some finely grated Parmesan
cheese of the best quality. Cover the pot and cook over a slow fire,
taking care that the artichokes should not boil for too long. Just
before serving up, pour some more melted butter over them.


_Artichokes ‘alla Spagnuola.’_

Remove the stalks and the hard leaves, and wash three (or more)
artichokes well and cut them into pieces. Boil, then drain, put them
into a sauce-pan with some pepper, five tablespoonfuls of sauce
‘Suprema’ (see Sauces, p. 125), five of Consommé, and then put them on
the fire for half an hour. Boil again for half an hour with fire above
and below, before serving them up hot.


_Artichokes ‘al Vapore.’_

Remove the hard outside leaves of the artichokes, but leave a little
of the stalk. Then place them upright in a small sauce-pan with a
little water which must not quite cover the artichokes. Open out the
artichokes and pour into the centre of each a sauce made of pepper,
salt, and fine olive oil. Then cover the sauce-pan and be careful to
boil the water well, so as to steam the artichokes thoroughly.

N.B.--Artichokes are eaten when barely half-grown in Italy.

_Asparagus ‘alla Borghese.’_

Take a bundle of asparagus, scrape the white of each stalk lightly, and
put them into cold water. Then tie them in bundles of twenty-five (or,
if very large, of twelve or fifteen), keep the heads together, and cut
the ends of one length. Cook them quickly for fifteen minutes in one
gallon of boiling water in which two ounces of salt has been put. Dish
them up on a piece of toast, serve very hot, with melted fresh butter,
or sauce ‘Alla Panna,’ or ‘All’ Olandese’ (see Sauces, pp. 124, 125).


_Asparagus ‘alla Casalinga.’_

Take four pounds of asparagus and cook the green part in boiling salted
water. Then drain, and put the asparagus into a baking-dish with four
ounces of fresh butter, sprinkle with grated cheese, salt and pepper to
taste, brown slightly, garnish with eggs fried in butter, and serve hot.


_Asparagus, cold._

Cut the ends of your asparagus so as to have them of equal length, and
boil in salted water. When cold lay them on a dish, and, just before
serving, pour over them a sauce made of good olive oil, white wine
vinegar, salt, and pepper. (If preferred, a white sauce can be used
instead of oil and vinegar.)


_Asparagus ‘alla Crema.’_

Take the heads only of the asparagus (two or three pounds as required)
and put them into boiling water with a little salt. Boil for about
fifteen minutes, and prepare meanwhile some square pieces of roll or
white bread, without the crust. Scoop out the centre of each piece and
put in a bit of butter, then fry (or bake) until the bread turns a good
yellow colour. After draining the heads of the asparagus place them in
the holes in the bread, taking care to keep them hot. Then boil half a
pint of milk, add four yolks of eggs, and stir till solid. Take it off
the fire, add a little butter, a sprinkling of salt and pepper, pour
over the asparagus and bread, and serve up hot.


_Asparagus ‘Fritto.’_

Cut the heads off a bunch of asparagus, boil them in slightly salted
water for about fifteen minutes, and then strain. Put half a tumbler
of cream, in which the yolk of an egg and two ounces of butter have
been well beaten up, into a frying-pan, add a tablespoonful of sugar,
salt and pepper to taste, and stir slowly over the fire for five or six
minutes. Then fry your asparagus heads in it and serve very hot.


_Asparagus ‘ai Gamberi.’_

Cut the tender heads of the asparagus in equal lengths and boil them,
then pickle them in good olive oil, salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg.
Stick a hunch of bread into the centre of a dish, cover it with sauce
‘Mayonnaise,’ and place the asparagus heads (over which you have just
squeezed some lemon juice) round and over it. Garnish the dish with
sauce ‘Mayonnaise’ (see Sauces, p. 123) and crayfish tails, and serve.
Some jelly will be an addition.


_Asparagus ‘in Istufato.’_

Cut the heads off a bunch of asparagus and wash them well in cold
salted water. Strain, and when dry put them into a sauce-pan with a
tablespoonful of flour, four ounces of butter, half a pint of cream (or
milk), and a little salt and pepper. Leave them on the fire until they
begin to boil, then remove, and serve up hot.


_Asparagus tips ‘all’ Italiana.’_

Prepare about 200 asparagus tips two or two and a half inches long,
half cook, and then drain them. Put them in a baking-pan with fresh
butter and strong gravy, taking care that they should be well glacées.
Cook fifteen or eighteen eggs for five minutes, shell them and keep
them warm in hot water. Pile a stiff purée of potatoes dome-shaped on
a dish, arrange your asparagus heads (pointing upwards) round it, heat
the dish well, and stand your eggs upright all round, pouring a white
sauce over them. Serve very hot.


_Asparagus ‘all’ Olandese.’_

Take a bunch of asparagus and scrape the stalks well. Cut them of equal
length and put them into boiling salted water (if they are not all of
the same size, put the biggest in first, or the small ones will be too
much cooked) and boil fast. Drain well, and place them on a napkin in a
dish, with sauce ‘Olandese’ (see Sauces, p. 124) in a sauce-boat apart.


_Asparagus ‘alla Parmigiana.’_

Scrape and boil your asparagus and place them on a dish, pour over them
a sauce of melted fresh butter mixed with strong gravy, some grated
Parmesan cheese, and a little pepper; then powder them with a little
grated Parmesan cheese, pour some more melted butter over them, colour
with the salamander and serve immediately.


_Asparagus ‘Perlate.’_

Cut the heads of a bunch of asparagus into small pieces like peas, and
put them into salted boiling water. When almost cooked, drain, and put
them into a sauce-pan with four ounces of fresh butter and a little
powdered sugar, sprinkle well with flour, and pour a little soup, or
sauce ‘Vellutata’ over them (see Sauces, p. 127). When thoroughly
cooked, mix two or three well-beaten-up yolks of eggs with them, and
serve very hot.


_Asparagus tips ‘alla Suprema.’_

Choose asparagus of about the same size, break off the tenderest part
with your fingers, and cut them in small bits, cooking the tips last.
Put them into salted boiling water, then drain, and place them in a
baking-pan with melted fresh butter, keep them a few minutes on the
fire, add some salt, a little gravy, fresh butter and lemon juice.
Serve hot.


_Asparagus on Toast. No. 1._

Wash the asparagus well and scrape the stalks, then tie in bunches and
put them into an earthenware pot of boiling water slightly salted; boil
for about twenty minutes, until they are tender but not over-done, cut
some toasted bread into square pieces (without the crust), and put a
bit of butter on each piece. When the asparagus is cooked and drained,
untie the bunches and place it on the toast, taking care to lay the
heads all the same way. Then melt four ounces of fresh butter with
a little flour in a frying-pan, and add a pinch of salt and pepper.
Serve the sauce separately, or a sauce ‘Olandese’ if better liked (see
Sauces, p. 124).


_Asparagus on Toast. No. 2._

Cut off the bottom of the stalks of a bunch of asparagus to make them
even, and put them into a pan of cold water till near dinner-time. Then
put the bunch in boiling water in which a pinch of soda, the weight of
a pea, has been dissolved. Boil a quarter of an hour, then drain, cut
the twine and serve. Have the buttered toast ready, place the white
ends of the asparagus on it and pour one tablespoonful of melted butter
over the green heads in the dish.


_Asparagus ‘alla Wilhelmina.’_

Wash and clean a bunch of asparagus and cook in boiling water slightly
salted. When cooked and dried, arrange them in a dish, one-half on one
side, one-half on the other, so that the heads meet in the middle.
Melt four ounces of fresh butter in a frying-pan, add a little flour
and some good broth, mix well together and boil, then add one or two
bay leaves, some chopped parsley and onion, salt and pepper to taste,
and three well-beaten-up yolks of eggs. Boil for five minutes, add a
little lemon juice, pour the sauce over the asparagus, and serve up
very hot.

_Beans (Broad) ‘al Burro.’_

Shell one quart of fresh young broad beans and put them in cold water.
Put two quarts of water in a sauce-pan and add a slice of ham, a stick
of celery, a bunch of parsley, three cloves, twenty peppercorns, and
one bay leaf. Boil for a quarter of an hour, then take out the ham,
etc., and put in the beans. Strain as soon as they are tender, add
four ounces of fresh butter and put them on the fire for a few minutes
before serving.


_Beans (Broad) ‘alla Romana.’_

Chop up one small onion and four or five sage leaves, and fry brown in
butter. Put in a quart of young shelled broad beans, cover them with
boiling water and stew over a very slow fire for twenty minutes, add
the strained juice of six tomatoes (or some tomato conserve), with salt
and pepper to taste. Add boiling water whenever necessary, and stir
often, to prevent the beans from sticking to the sauce-pan. Stew for
twenty or twenty-five minutes, and serve very hot.


_Beans (Broad) ‘alla Turca.’_

Take a quart of young broad bean pods, about two inches long, cut them
in half and put them in cold water. Then cook them in a sauce-pan
with two quarts of boiling water. Drain, and again put them in cold
water. Mince some ham and fry it with a little butter in a sauce-pan,
throw your beans in, toss, and heat them for ten minutes. Add three
tablespoonfuls good stock before serving up hot.

_Beans (Broad) ‘al Vino.’_

Take quite young shelled broad beans and stew them in a sauce-pan with
a little browned onion, some ham, butter, sweet herbs, and flour;
moisten well with broth, add a quarter of a pint of sweet white wine,
and three spoonfuls of sugar. Serve hot.


_Beans (French) ‘al Burro.’_

Remove the strings and the ends from one quart of French beans and
cut them into pieces about an inch long. Put them into cold water for
twenty or thirty minutes, then dry, and throw them into a sauce-pan of
boiling water with some salt and butter. Cook slowly for about half an
hour (according to the age of the beans), then place them in a dish,
adding some fresh butter, salt and pepper. Serve up hot.


_Beans (French) ‘alla Crema.’ No. 1._

Boil one quart of French beans slowly until nearly tender; then dry,
and put them to cook in fresh butter. Mix a teacupful of cream, an egg,
some grated cheese, and some allspice well together in a sauce-pan,
then add some lemon juice, a little white wine vinegar, and boil. Pour
this sauce over the beans, mix well, and serve up hot.


_Beans (French) ‘alla Crema.’ No. 2._

Break off both ends and string two quarts of young fresh French beans,
wash in cold water, and drain. Put them into salted boiling water and
cook for five minutes, stirring them well. Season with a teaspoonful of
salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, one or two chives, and some sprigs
of parsley (to be taken out before serving); add half a tea-cup of
fresh cream (or milk), and two yolks of eggs, heat for five minutes,
but do not boil. A tablespoonful of pounded sugar is an agreeable
addition.


_Beans (French) ‘allo Zabajone.’_

Clean and remove the strings from two quarts of French beans and put
them into cold water; then boil and strain, and lay them in a dish.
Put two yolks of eggs, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, two of white wine
vinegar, and two of water, into a sauce-pan on a slow fire, mix and
heat, but do not allow it to boil. Pour the sauce over the beans, and
serve hot.


_Beans (Haricots) ‘alla Bruna.’_

Put a quart of haricot beans into a sauce-pan of salted boiling water,
and boil for about half an hour. When cooked brown, put four ounces of
butter in a frying-pan, add two or three tablespoonfuls of flour, and
fry them well together. Then add some broth, stir well, and add half an
onion minced up with salt and pepper. Dry the beans, put them in the
sauce, boil all together for ten minutes, and serve hot.


_Beans (Haricots), Croquettes of._

Put a quart of small white haricot beans to soak in tepid water all
night long; dry, put them in cold water, and boil over a slow fire
for about an hour. Drain and dry them again, and put into boiling
water for another hour. Pass them through a sieve and put them in a
sauce-pan with four ounces of fresh butter, one tablespoonful of white
wine vinegar, one of balm-mint, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well
together, cook, and let cool. Then roll up into balls (or croquets),
dip them into the yolk of an egg, cover them with finely grated

Wash the beetroot carefully without cutting or scraping it (if the skin
is broken the beet loses flavour and colour). Young ones take one hour
to boil, old ones four. In winter the beet must be put into cold water
overnight to make it tender, those that remain hard are unfit to eat.
It must be cooked in boiling water, then put into cold water for five
or six minutes, when it can be rubbed with a cloth to take off the
peel. Cut into slices, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and pour melted
fresh butter over it; or it can be put into the oven to bake. Boiled
beetroot when wanted for salad ought to be put into wine vinegar to
soak.

twelve pumpkin flowers, some young artichokes properly prepared and
cut into quarters (if not quite young and tender they must be boiled
first), some cauliflower and bits of cardoon, dip them in egg and dust
them with flour. Do the same to some parboiled calves’ brains, flour
the slices of pumpkin, and fry all together in pure olive oil. Use
dripping or lard for frying if you have not got good oil. Season with a
sprinkling of salt. Serve very hot.


_Fritto of Vegetables._

maccaroni and cut it into small pieces, then mince one pound of roast
veal, four ounces of ham, slice four hard-boiled eggs, and mix with
one and a half tablespoonfuls of finely chopped-up sweet herbs, add
salt and pepper to taste. Butter a mould, and sprinkle it well with
bread-crumbs, then line it with thin paste; put in alternate layers of
maccaroni sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese, and of force-meat,
until the mould is full; add half a pint of good stock, cover with
paste and bake in a slow oven for about forty minutes. Serve hot.


_Maccaroni ‘Timbale alla Milanese.’_

Take one pound of flour, one pound of butter, a quarter of an ounce

slices of hare, veal, or sweetbread, truffles and small mushrooms to
the maccaroni.


_Maccaroni ‘Timbale alla Napolitana.’_

Boil half a pound of maccaroni as in ‘alla Crema.’ Prepare a timbale
shape about seven inches in diameter and butter it. Arrange long
maccaroni round and round the mould inside until it is covered, and

begins to brown, add six or seven tomatoes cut in slices, and salt and
pepper to taste. When they are cooked strain off the gravy. Meanwhile
make a paste as in ‘Tagliatelle with Ham,’ parboil in plenty of
slightly salted water, then put it into a sauce-pan, pour the hot gravy
over it, add some butter and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, mix, and
serve at once.

a spoonful on to little rounds of paste (about two and a half inches
in diameter). Fold the paste over the curds, as you would a turnover,
and put them into boiling salted water. Take them out with a strainer,
season with butter and Parmesan cheese and serve hot. The quantities
given ought to make about twenty-four tortelli.

large dish, and mash them well with a wooden spoon. Add two ounces of
fresh butter, and pour in half a tumbler of cream (a little at a time).
Beat up well with the spoon until the paste is smooth, then add three
or four well-beaten-up yolks of eggs. Butter a mould and pour in the
potato paste, make a hole in the centre, put small whole mushrooms into
it, cover them with a piece of the paste, and cook in the oven. When
baked, turn out the pudding on to a dish and serve hot.


_Potatoes ‘in Ragoût.’_

six sliced leeks. Boil for ten minutes, then drain. Boil half a bunch
of asparagus, drain, cut off their heads, and add them to the potatoes
and leeks, mixing well together. Meanwhile put two ounces of butter,
one pint of milk, one tablespoonful of chopped chervil, pepper and
salt to taste, into a sauce-pan, mix slowly over the fire until hot,
then pour over the potatoes, leeks, and asparagus, and boil the whole
together. Serve very hot.


_Potatoes ‘Arrostite’ (Roasted)._

Choose two pounds of young, round, and equal-sized potatoes. Put them
into a sauce-pan with four ounces of butter, salt to taste, and cover

three-quarters of an hour the potatoes will have a brown crust, and
inside they will be white and tender.


_Potatoes ‘Sautées.’_

Cut three or four cold, boiled potatoes into dice, and put them, a
few at a time, so that they shall not overlap one another, into a
frying-pan with fresh butter. (Allow one tablespoonful of butter for
each potato.) Brown them well, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve
immediately.


_Potatoes ‘in Stufato.’_

Cut ten large potatoes into dice and put them into cold water for a
quarter of an hour. Drain, and cook in boiling water for about ten

_Pumpkins ‘alla Fiorentina.’_

Take twelve very young pumpkins (about one and a half inches long), cut
them in half, and put them in cold water. Have a sauce-pan ready with
four quarts of salted water. When boiling put in the pumpkins. When
they are cooked put them again into cold water. Just before serving
place them in a sauce-pan with four ounces of butter, heat for three
minutes, then add two tablespoonfuls of veal broth, two of cream, and a
squeeze of lemon. Heat again and serve.


_Pumpkins ‘Fritti.’_

Take young pumpkins (about the size of your two fists), peel them, cut
them in half, and take out seeds and pulp. Cut them into thin strips
(one and a half or two inches long, and as wide as your finger),
and put them into a dish with salt for some hours. Then squeeze out
the water with your hands, and throw them into flour, taking care to
separate and cover each strip with flour, shake the superfluous flour
off them in a sieve, and put them into a frying-pan with plenty of
boiling lard or oil. Serve at once.


_Pumpkin Pudding (Bodino)._

Cook (but not too much) two and a half pounds of pumpkin with two
ounces of butter, a little pepper, allspice, and salt, and pass
through a sieve, adding some crumb of bread soaked in milk or cream,
some powdered cinnamon, several pounded bitter almonds, a handful of
grated bread, and three yolks of eggs. Mix thoroughly and put it into a

the inside, and cook with a fire above and below until thoroughly
browned. Serve up hot.


_Pumpkins ‘Ripiene.’ No. 1._

one slice of tongue, and one of ham; put them into a sauce-pan with
three tablespoonfuls of veal broth, the yolk of an egg, a pinch of
salt, and one of pepper; parboil; therewith fill the pumpkins. Butter

_Rice (How to cook)._

Place a large sauce-pan with water on a hot fire; it is necessary that
the water should boil violently in order to keep the grains of rice
separate. Wash the rice in several waters so as to remove the floury
coating, which makes it pasty. Drain, and drop it gradually into the
sauce-pan, so as not to stop the boiling. Then boil hard for a quarter
of an hour or twenty minutes. When the rice is soft to the touch, it is
done. Then drain off every drop of water, sprinkle with salt, cover the
sauce-pan with a thin napkin, and leave it by the fire to steam and get
dry. (The rice can also be put into a cullender to drain, and then into
an open oven to dry; or butter the interior of a stew-pan, put in the
rice, put on the lid tight, and stand the pan on a trivet in the oven,
or by the fire.)


_Rice ‘alla Casalinga.’_

Wash eight ounces of rice, and blanch it in a sauce-pan with two quarts
of water for five minutes, then strain and let it cool. Meanwhile fry
four ounces of lean bacon cut up into small pieces, and when browned,
add one and a half pints of stock and a small teaspoonful of white
pepper. Put in the rice, cook for twenty minutes, stirring every now
and then, take it off the fire, add half a tumbler of Tomato sauce (see
Sauces, p. 126), or conserve, and mix well. Turn out the rice on to a
hot dish, and garnish with small sausages.


_Rice Croquettes._

Boil a cupful of rice in weak chicken broth, drain, stir in two
beaten-up eggs, one teaspoonful of butter, a slight sprinkling of
flour, pepper, and a pinch of grated lemon-peel. Flour your hands, and
make the rice, when cold, into small sausages (or croquettes), roll
each in raw egg, and then in bread crumbs, and fry to a golden brown.


_Rice with Tomatoes. No. 1._

Boil one cupful of rice soft in hot water, shake it now and then, but
do not stir it. Drain, and add a little milk in which a beaten egg has
been mixed, one teaspoonful of butter, and a little pepper and salt.
Simmer for five minutes, and if the rice has not absorbed all the milk,
drain it again. Put the rice round a dish, smooth it into a wall, wash
it over with the yolk of a beaten-up egg, and put it into the oven till
firm. Take half a bottle of tomato conserve (or the strained juice
and pulp of seven or eight tomatoes), season with pepper, a little
salt, sugar, and half a chopped onion, stew for twenty minutes, then
stir in one tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of fine
bread-crumbs. Stew three or four minutes to thicken, and then pour the
tomato into the dish in the middle of the rice, and serve.


_Rice with Tomatoes. No. 2._

Boil one cupful of rice as directed in ‘How to boil Rice’; add half a
cupful of Tomato sauce (see Sauces, p. 126), season with some butter,
salt, and pepper to taste, and one or two bay leaves. Toss, or mix
lightly with a fork, being careful not to mash the grains. Serve hot.
This makes a nice dish for winter.


_Rice with Prawns._

Mince up half an onion, one clove of garlic, one carrot, half a head
of celery, and a bunch of parsley, and brown in pure olive oil. Then
put six or seven ounces of prawns into the sauce-pan, and season with
salt and pepper. Turn them often, and when all are red put in two or
three tablespoonfuls of Tomato sauce (or conserve), and add enough hot
water to cook fourteen or fifteen ounces of rice in afterwards. Do not
boil too much, as prawns cook fast. Take the prawns out, dry them,
choose about a third of the finest, shell and lay them aside. Pound
the others in a mortar (shells and all), rub them through a sieve, and
mix again with the water in which they were cooked. Meanwhile put some
butter into a sauce-pan, add the rice, stir well, and as soon as it
has taken up the butter, pour the water little by little on to it.
When half-boiled add the shelled prawns, and before serving sprinkle
Parmesan cheese over the whole.


_Rice with Quails._

Mince up two or four slices of ham and a quarter of an onion, and
brown in a sauce-pan, then put in four quails ready drawn. Sprinkle
with pepper and salt, and as soon as they are browned, parboil them in
broth, then add fourteen ounces of rice, and boil all together. Powder
with grated Parmesan cheese and serve on a hot dish.


_Rice ‘alla Ristori.’_

Cut two ounces of bacon into small pieces, and put them into a
sauce-pan with chopped-up cabbage. Steam for half an hour and add a
little salt, pepper, and chopped parsley; then throw in a quarter of

eighteen minutes, and serve with grated Parmesan cheese sprinkled over
it.

ten ounces of clean rice (Italian if possible) and two large truffles
chopped up. Stir without stopping for one and a half minutes, and add
one quart of boiling veal broth, stir and let it cook for fourteen
minutes. Add six chopped-up mushrooms, and, a little at a time, one
more quart of broth, stirring constantly over a sharp fire for ten
minutes more. Put in half a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, one
and a half ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, and a teaspoonful of
saffron soaked in two tablespoonfuls of hot broth, and strained. Cook
three or four minutes longer, stirring all the time, then pour into a
deep dish, and serve hot with some grated Parmesan cheese separate. It
is an improvement to put a tablespoonful of marrow into the centre just
before serving.


_Risotto ‘alla Milanese.’ No. 2._

Cut up an onion and cook it with one and a half ounces of beef marrow,
and the same quantity of good butter; when browned put in one pound of
rice and add three-quarters of a glass of good white wine and broth
enough to cook the rice. Before taking off the fire add one and a half
ounces of butter and some grated Parmesan cheese, and serve with more
grated cheese separately.


_Risotto with Peas._

Mince up one small onion, brown it in two ounces of butter, then put in
one pound of rice, and stir with a ladle until the rice has taken up
all the butter. Add hot water (a cupful at a time), sprinkle with salt,
and let it boil dry, adding two ounces of butter. Before taking it off
the fire add peas cooked ‘alla Borghese’ omitting the milk and eggs.
Mix, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, and serve hot.


_Risotto ‘alla Poggio Gherardo.’_

Mince an onion, put it into a three-quart sauce-pan, and brown with
three ounces of good butter. Take out the onion, put in one pound of
rice, and half a wineglassful of Marsala. Reduce over a brisk fire,
then add one quart of stock, and boil hard so as to reduce in eighteen
minutes. Then take it off the fire and season with one ounce of good
butter, one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, three or four fowls’
livers and mushrooms minced up fine, and some good gravy. Serve hot.

Take four ounces of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, pepper and
salt to taste, and mix well over the fire in a sauce-pan. Do not let
it boil, and just before serving add two ounces of capers and one
teaspoonful of white wine vinegar.


_Cold Caper Sauce. No. 4._

Take pure olive oil, four ounces of capers and the juice of a lemon.
Mix them well together and serve.


_Butter Sauce. No. 1._

Put two ounces of flour into one quart of water, with one and a half
ounces of butter, and a little salt and pepper. Cook for twenty
minutes, stirring well, then strain into a covered bowl and put into
a Bain-marie. Just before serving boil again, take off the fire, add
twelve ounces of butter cut into pieces, and the juice of one fine
lemon. The heat of the sauce must melt the butter as it must not be put
on the fire again. If the sauce is too thick mix in half a wineglassful
of hot water.


_Butter Sauce. No. 2. (Melted Butter.)_

Take eight ounces of butter, one tablespoonful of salt, one of pepper,
and two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Stir with a wooden spoon over
the fire until the butter is half melted, then take it off and continue
to stir until it is quite liquid. By taking the butter off the fire
before it is all melted, it will have a pleasant taste of fresh cream;
this is lost when fully cooked.


_Francese Sauce._

Stir six yolks of eggs, seventeen ounces of butter, salt and pepper
to taste, well together. When they begin to consolidate mix in one
wineglassful of purée of tomatoes passed through a fine sieve, one
ounce of chicken jelly, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and one
teaspoonful of capsicum vinegar.


_Lombarda Sauce._

Put two tumblers of white roux and one of chicken jelly into a
sauce-pan, reduce, and add three yolks of eggs mixed with two ounces
of butter and the juice of half a lemon. Before it boils take the
sauce-pan off the fire and add one tumbler of thick Tomato sauce (see
Sauces, p. 126) (or conserve), strain, and just before serving add one
tablespoonful of sweet herbs minced fine.


_Mayonnaise Sauce._

Put one yolk of egg (quite free from any white), half a teaspoonful
of salt, and a pinch of cayenne, into a bowl standing in ice. Stir
constantly, and add one cupful of pure olive oil, drop by drop. The
goodness of the sauce depends upon adding the oil slowly. When it
begins to get thick, alternate a few drops of tarragon vinegar with the
oil till you have put in one and a half teaspoonfuls of vinegar (lemon
juice may be used instead). In summer it is a good plan to mix the yolk
of a hard-boiled egg with the raw one; the sauce is made more quickly
and is less likely to curdle.


_Mayonnaise Monte Bianco Sauce._

To the above Mayonnaise sauce add half a cupful of stiff whipped cream
just before serving.


_Mayonnaise Sauce ‘alla Ravigote.’_

Take a few sprigs of tarragon, parsley, chervil, watercress, two or
three chives, and a leaf of spinach or lettuce, and pound them in a

herbs, and mix it with mayonnaise sauce (as above). A few green peas
will add to the colour and consistency of the sauce.


_Olandese Sauce._

Rub four ounces of butter to a cream in a sauce-pan or a bowl, add four
yolks of eggs, beat well together, then put in half a teaspoonful of
salt, the juice of half a lemon, a pinch of cayenne, and one cupful of
hot water poured in by degrees. Mix well and put into a Bain-marie.
Stir until the sauce becomes of the consistency of thick cream, but
be careful it does not boil. Take it off the fire and stir for some
minutes. ‘Olandese’ sauce ought to be quite smooth and creamy.


_‘Alla Panna’ Sauce._

Melt half a pound of butter, add a little flour, salt, pepper, and
grated nutmeg. Stir until thick, then add one pint of cream, a little
chopped parsley, and heat for five minutes.


_Suprema Sauce. No. 1._

knuckle of veal and the body of a fowl. Boil well, skimming off the
grease, add one teaspoonful of salt, two onions (one of them stuck with
cloves), one bouquet, and a pinch of grated nutmeg. Simmer on the hob
until the veal is quite cooked, then strain. Add three tablespoonfuls
of white roux and stir over the fire until it boils. Skim, and put it
into a Bain-marie to reduce. Just before serving boil it again and add
one ounce of butter and three tablespoonfuls of milk of sweet almonds.


_Suprema Sauce. No. 2._

Put the body of a fowl into a sauce-pan, cover it with water, and cook
quickly. Take it out as soon as it boils, drain, and wash it well. Then
put the fowl into a clean sauce-pan, with one quart of veal broth, one
dessert-spoonful of salt, and a bouquet. Cook for forty-five minutes,
then pour the broth through a strainer into another sauce-pan with two
tablespoonfuls of white roux, and stir well.


_Tartara Sauce. No. 1._

Take one shallot, one tablespoonful of capers, six sprigs of tarragon,
six of chervil, and two gherkins; chop all up very fine and put them
into an earthen bowl with two raw yolks of eggs, half a teaspoonful of
ground mustard, a small pinch of salt, and one of pepper, then stir in
(a drop at a time) one teaspoonful of good wine vinegar, and then a
cupful of pure olive oil.


_Tartara Sauce. No. 2._

Wash and mince two anchovies with the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs.
Mince separately some parsley, tarragon, one shallot (or a small
onion). Put them into a bowl with one tablespoonful of white wine
vinegar, one and a half of olive oil, one of French mustard, and a
little pepper and salt. Beat up well with a wooden spoon till quite
smooth.


_Tomato Sauce. No. 1._

Mince a quarter of an onion, half a stalk of celery, a few leaves of
sweet basil, and a bunch of parsley, up fine. Add half a cupful of
pure olive oil, a pinch of salt and one of pepper, and cut eight or
nine tomatoes into slices. Boil until the sauce is as thick as cream,
stirring occasionally, then strain through a sieve and serve. Eight or
nine tablespoonfuls of conserve can be used instead of fresh tomatoes.


_Tomato Sauce. No. 2._

Take four pounds of tomatoes, cut them in two and put them into a
two-quart sauce-pan with two wineglassfuls of water, two saltspoonfuls
of salt, one of pepper, and a bouquet. Cover the sauce-pan and boil for
forty minutes, stirring often to prevent burning; then strain. Make a
roux in another sauce-pan with one ounce of butter, and three-quarters
of an ounce of flour. Cook for three minutes, mixing well. Take the
roux off the fire and pour the tomatoes into it a little at a time,
stirring to keep it smooth. Add two wineglassfuls of stock, put on the
fire, and cook for twenty minutes, stirring all the time.


_Vellutata Sauce._

Put one pound of knuckle of veal and any scraps you have of fowl into a
well-buttered sauce-pan with two or three slices of ham, two carrots,
one onion, and one tumbler of veal broth. When the broth is reduced add
twelve mushrooms, two or three shallots, salt and pepper to taste, a
bouquet, and enough veal broth to cover the meat. Boil, skim off the
fat, and let it simmer for one and a half hours. It will keep some days
if well corked in a cold place. Before using mix white roux with it.

_Sorrel Purée._

Nip the stalks off a peck of sorrel, wash well, drain, and chop up fine
with one head of well-washed lettuce and a small bunch of chervil. Put
all into a sauce-pan and stir over a hot fire for three minutes, then
place in the oven until well dissolved. Add one and a half ounces of
fresh butter, stir until it bubbles, add half a pint of good stock or
beef gravy, and cook for five minutes.


_Sorrel Purée (Maigre)._

Take sorrel as above, but instead of stock or gravy, add two yolks of
eggs and half a cupful of cream.

rub through a sieve into a stew-pan. Add one or two tablespoonfuls of
Béchamel sauce (see Sauces, p. 119), a little salt and sugar, and two

earthen pot, boil, add the artichokes, two ounces of butter, and three
tablespoonfuls of flour. Stir until the milk thickens, add pepper and
salt to taste, and boil for ten minutes, adding chicken forcemeat balls
just before serving. (For the forcemeat balls take four tablespoonfuls

ten minutes (until the eggs have set). Serve up on the baking-dish very
hot, with a sauce Béchamel (see Sauces, p. 119), or some brown gravy.

_Truffles in Champagne._

Wash and brush well twelve truffles in warm water, then rinse them in
cold water and drain. Lay slices of bacon in the bottom of a stew-pan,
and place the truffles on them. Put in a bouquet, sprinkle with a
little salt, add some good stock, half a bottle of champagne, and boil.
Cover the pan well, put fire above and below, and cook for one hour.
See whether they are done (they should yield to the touch), then drain
well, and serve in a folded napkin.


_Truffles and Cheese._

Wash, brush, and clean eight ounces of truffles, and slice them.
Meanwhile fry four ounces of butter with one or two tablespoonfuls of
pure olive oil; put in the sliced truffles with four ounces of good
Swiss cheese cut in fine slices. Mix well together over a brisk fire
for ten minutes. Season with pepper and salt, and serve very hot with
croûtons (fried bread).


_Truffles (Maigre)._

Wash, brush, and clean some truffles, cut them in slices, and put them
in a stew-pan with some fish soup. Add a bouquet, season with pepper
and salt, and stew over a small fire. When done thicken the sauce with
a maigre roux, take out the bouquet, and serve hot.


_Truffles in Omelette._

Beat up eight fresh eggs for an omelette, add a very little salt and a
pinch of grated nutmeg. Cut up fine four ounces of truffles already
boiled in Madeira wine, warm up with one pint of good gravy reduced
with Madeira wine. Make the omelette, and put the truffles in as you
turn it over.


_Truffles ‘alla Panna.’_

Wash, brush, peel, and clean twenty or twenty-four truffles, and put
them into an earthen pan with four ounces of butter, a little salt, one
glass of white Rhine wine, and three tablespoonfuls of reduced stock.
Put a layer of sauce ‘alla Panna’ (see Sauces, p. 125) in the bottom of
a silver (or enamelled) sauce-pan, then a third of the truffles, cover
them again with a layer of sauce, add half the remaining truffles, and
some more sauce; at last the rest of the truffles must be covered with
sauce sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese and browned quickly with
the salamander just before serving. The truffles may be cooked and
served in shells instead of a sauce-pan.


_Truffles Sautés._

Wash, brush, and clean about one pound of truffles, cut them in thin
slices, and put them into a stew-pan with a quarter of a pound of
butter, one teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of sugar, and
a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg. Warm over the fire, then add one
gill of broth, and half a tablespoonful of flour mixed with half a
tablespoonful of butter. Stir well, boil, and serve on toast.


_Truffles Stewed._

Wash, brush, and clean some truffles, cut them in slices, and put them
into a small stew-pan with three or four slices of ham, a pinch of
pepper, one cupful (or more) of good gravy, and a bouquet. Stew gently
over a small fire until the truffles are tender, take out the ham and
the bouquet, add some good brown gravy, and serve.


_Truffles ‘sul tovagliolo.’_

Wash, brush, and clean some truffles thoroughly, boil with veal stock
and a glass of Madeira wine. Then serve in a napkin with good fresh
butter separate.

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
