# We don't want to run Alfresco as root so let's create:

groupadd alfresco # a dedicated group

useradd -m alfresco -g alfresco # and a dedicated user


# optional but very handy
# this one below could be put in /etc/profile.d/alfresco_aliases.sh
# so you'll have it for every user

vim /etc/profile.d/alfresco_aliases.sh


alias AGP='vim /opt/alfresco/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco-global.properties'

alias COUT='less /opt/alfresco/tomcat/logs/catalina.out'

alias MMT='/opt/alfresco/java/bin/java -jar /opt/alfresco/bin/alfresco-mmt.jar'



# exit bash and log in again
