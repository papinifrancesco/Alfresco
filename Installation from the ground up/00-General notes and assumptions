# When I started with Alfresco I was puzzled because the "took for granted" knowledge in the official documentation is what I hadn't at the time,
# so this guide is meant to be as simple as possible and be usable by people that have no prior specific knowledge at all.

# This guide doesn't (and probably never will) cover every possible scenario but one and one only:
# Single node installation with everything in the same, single, VM.

# These scripts are a collection of commands to be executed manually, because they do NOT have error control logic and their purpose it not to automate
# Alfresco's installation but to make you aware of the many components and how to configure them.

# This installation assumes that:
# 1) these symlinks will be used:
# /opt/activemq
# /opt/alfresco
# /opt/solr
# /opt/solr_data
# Real installation folders can be anywhere but symlinks will be used, that way if we need to change the real path for some reasons, we won't be in need to change all the internal references among the many Alfresco's files: everything will always point to the symlinks

# 2) RHEL based OS

# 3) Database : PostgreSQL

# 4) All extra scripts will be in /opt/alfresco/scripts

# 5) For ANY file we plan to modify, make a copy of it first with ".ORIG" extension for original files, example: cp -a server.xml server.xml.ORIG
# with the .BAK-YYYY-MM-DD_User for backup up the current file before a modification
# example: cp -a server.xml server.xml.BAK.2021-05-13_fpapini
# later on it'll be easy to find which files were modified, by whom and how

# 6) Testing with you browser :
# it is better to use an "incognito" "InPrivate" "private" window : cookies might not be your
# best friends especially after an Alfresco upgrade. If you want to use your "regular" browser,
# clean at least the cookies related to the Alfresco site you're going to test and yes, if you
# use tunnels, clear all 127.x.x.x or localhost related cookies as well.

# 7) Alfresco Supported Platforms will always be open in a tab of your browser
#    https://docs.alfresco.com/content-services/latest/support/
# but keep in mind that small variations (a more up to date DB) might be possible

# 8) create a folder where to store your files
MYstuff=/tmp/work
mkdir "$MYstuff"
