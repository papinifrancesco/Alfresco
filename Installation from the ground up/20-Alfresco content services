# Get the Alfresco package from the official site:
# the enterprise version if you have a licence 
# (you'll know what to get and where)
# or
# the community version if you don't have one at:
# https://www.alfresco.com/thank-you/thank-you-downloading-alfresco-community-edition
# 
# extract the Alfresco archive in /opt and create the symlink, for example:
cd /opt/
ln -s alfresco-content-services-7.3.0 alfresco

# download a supported Tomcat, point 7) again, for example:
https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.75/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.75.tar.gz

# extract the Tomcat archive and move/rename it /opt/alfresco/tomcat (no symlinks here)
# to clarify we should have:

/opt/alfresco/tomcat/bin

# but not:

/opt/alfresco/apache-tomcat-9.0.75/bin


# because a lot of script assume to have the former path and not the latter
