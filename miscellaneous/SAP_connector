# The offical and public documentation is clear
# just some notes on how to enable the debug logs
# and to resolve a specific issue.

# First of all, logging properties in custom-log4j.properties
# I prefer to define the object to be logged here at only WARN level
# and enable the DEBUG level using GUI when needed at:
# http://FQDN:PORT/alfresco/s/enterprise/admin/admin-log-settings
log4j.logger.com.alfresco.integrations.sap.archivelink.functions = WARN
log4j.logger.com.alfresco.integrations.sap.archivelink.beans = WARN
log4j.logger.com.alfresco.integrations.sap.webscripts = WARN
log4j.logger.com.alfresco.integrations.sap.repo.jobs = WARN
log4j.logger.com.alfresco.integrations.sap.repo.behaviours = WARN
log4j.logger.com.alfresco.integrations.sap.repo.exceptions = WARN


# Problem: communication starting from ACS and going to SAP (doesn't work).
# it seems weird since the opposite does but remember, we have to flows:
# from SAP to ACS

# from ACS to SAP
# in this latter case its importanto to check in alfresco-global.properties:
integrations.sap.system.1.host
integrations.sap.system.1.user
integrations.sap.system.1.password
# sometimes the SAP user, usually "comalfresco" has an expired password
# ask SAP admins to reset it

# In catalina.out we might have:
2023-11-22 12:53:09,143  DEBUG [repo.behaviours.BehaviourCreateArchivelink] [SapContentConnectorBehaviourWorkerThread1] Setting '{{http://www.connexas.eu/model/administration/1.0}saperror=Initialization of repository destination ASPI - Test ECC failed: Name or password is incorrect (repeat logon):}' for NodeRef workspace://SpacesStore/c97563ee-582d-498e-a560-68a27b24bdde in transaction!

# AFTER having checked the "from ACS to SAP" section above and maybe fixed it, how can we trigger an update from ACS to SAP ?
# We get the NodeRef in the log : workspace://SpacesStore/c97563ee-582d-498e-a560-68a27b24bdde
# and we open it from the WebGUI:
http://FQDN:PORT/share/page/document-details?nodeRef=workspace://SpacesStore/c97563ee-582d-498e-a560-68a27b24bdde

# at the very bottom of the page we should see the error:
SAP Error: Initialization of repository destination ASPI - Test ECC failed: Name or password is incorrect (repeat logon):

# let's try to fix it by updating one the the properties of the node: pick a safe, not used one such as "SAP Description:"
click on "Edit Properties:"

in the "SAP Description:" field insert something such as "Manual fix from Alfresco", click "Save"

# at this time, at the bottom of the page we should have "SAP Error: (None)" but, if not, we will have to review the config with the SAP people.


An addition check would be opening the Node Browser and make sure our node has:
connexasCreatearchivelink:sapdescription	d:text	StringWeHaveWrittenManuallyBefore
connexasArchivelink:sapid               	d:text	c97563ee-582d-498e-a560-68a27b24bdde
connexasAdministration:sapstatus	        d:text	Sent to SAP	false	Delete
connexasAdministration:saperror	          d:text	null
